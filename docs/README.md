# Coder Dojo SV Mobile Game Modules

Over the course of our six week program some common patterns emerged. We took
the code from some of our games and extracted it into libraries.

The libraries we have so far are

[:books: grid](grid.md)  
[:books: character](character.md)  
[:books: controlpad](controlpad.md)
